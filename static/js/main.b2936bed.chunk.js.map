There are systematic processes for evaluating solutions with respect to how well they meet the criteria and constraints of a problem. Sometimes parts of different solutions can be combined to create a solution that is better than any of its predecessors. In any case, it is important to be able to communicate and explain solutions to others.\",\n     \"Product 1:\":\"Book\",\n     \"Product 2:\":\"Video\",\n     \"Product 3:\":\"Kit\"\n  },\n  {\n     \"practices\":[\n        {\n           \"title\":\"Asking Questions and Defining Problems\",\n           \"info\":\"Ask questions that arise from careful observation of phenomena, or unexpected results, to clarify and/or seek additional information.; Ask questions that arise from examining models or a theory, to clarify and/or seek additional information and relationships.\\nAsk questions to determine relationships, including quantitative relationships, between independent and dependent variables.; Ask questions to clarify and refine a model, an explanation, or an engineering problem.; Evaluate a question to determine if it is testable and relevant.; Ask questions that can be investigated within the scope of the school laboratory, research facilities, or field (e.g., outdoor environment) with available resources and, when appropriate, frame a hypothesis based on a model or theory.; Ask and/or evaluate questions that challenge the premise(s) of an argument, the interpretation of a data set, or the suitability of the design.; Define a design problem that involves the development of a process or system with interacting components and criteria and constraints that may include social, technical and/or environmental considerations.; Analyze complex real-world problems by specifying criteria and constraints for successful solutions.\"\n        },\n        {\n           \"title\":\"Developing and Using Models\",\n           \"info\":\"Evaluate merits and limitations of two different models of the same proposed tool, process, mechanism, or system in order to select or revise a model that best fits the evidence or design criteria.; Design a test of a model to ascertain its reliability.; Develop, revise, and/or use a model based on evidence to illustrate and/or predict the relationships between systems or between components of a system.; Develop and/or use multiple types of models to provide mechanistic accounts and/or predict phenomena, and move flexibly between model types based on merits and limitations.; Use a model to provide mechanistic accounts of phenomena.; Develop a complex model that allows for manipulation and testing of a proposed process or system.; Develop and/or use a model (including mathematical and computational) to generate data to support explanations, predict phenomena, analyze systems, and/or solve problems.\"\n        },\n        {\n           \"title\":\"Planning and Carrying Out Investigations\",\n           \"info\":\"Plan an investigation or test a design individually and collaboratively to produce data to serve as the basis for evidence as part of building and revising models, supporting explanations for phenomena, or testing solutions to problems.
